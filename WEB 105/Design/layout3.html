        <h2>The Story of Miguel’s Pizza</h2>
        <section>
            <p>Miguel Ventura was born in Portugal into a family of bakers. They moved to Connecticut in the 1960’s. As a teenager, Miguel was accepted at the Rhode Island School of Design, but he declined for financial reasons. Being a self taught artist, he instead opened an art studio in California, where he would endure the triumphs and failures of the creative world.
            After losing direction as an artist, he returned to Connecticut to start a family with his wife, Susan. After they married, they grew weary of the fast paced life of their town, so in 1983 they decided to move to a farm in Slade, KY with some friends. The rest will become history…and a lot of hard work.
            In 1984, they rented an old run down storefront called The Old Jottem Down Store and opened an ice cream shop which they called The Rainbow Door. In 1986, they decided to try to make pizza, and Miguel’s Pizza was born. For the first 20 years, they mostly ran the restaurant with the help of their growing children. During this time, the Ventura family befriended the hikers and rock climbers that came to the area, and slowly a campground developed. Known as “The Camp Four of the East,” climbers from all over came to set up camp, eat and sport the ever so popular Miguel;s Pizza t-shirt.    Over a thirty two year period, the Ventura family has managed to build their own house,  develop a farm, raise three children, take care of Miguel’s parents and keep their business thriving. As rock climbing and tourism have exploded in the last ten years, Miguel’s Pizza has made it’s name all around the world as a friendly and dependable place to find tasty, fresh and reasonably priced food with a great atmosphere in a world class location</p>

        <h2>One of America's Best Climbing Area</h2>
        <section>
            <p>Red River Gorge is just minutes down the road from Miguel's Pizza, the humming campground, restaurant and climbing emporium of the Red River Gorge, Kentucky. Matt and Amy Tackett had successfully cultivated Red River Gorge, a breakfast, Internet and guide-service boutique, into a staple of the geographically diffuse but tight-knit climbing community that calls the Red home.</p>

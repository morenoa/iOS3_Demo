Your clothing should breathe, wick sweat and dry fast so that you can stay warm and comfortable while climbing. If youâ€™re climbing in the outdoors, also carry clothes for changing conditions just as you would for hiking.</td>

All harnesses have two front tie-in points designed specifically for threading the rope and tying in, one at the waist and one at the leg loops. The right harness model depends on the type of climbing you plan on doing.</td>

To lessen environmental impact, it's good form to use a chalk that matches the color of the rock you're climbing. Chalk is carried in a small pouch slung from your waist by a lightweight belt. </td>

Used correctly, a belay device increases friction that helps the belayer catch a fall, lower a climber, pay the rope out gradually as the climber advances, or reel in slack smoothly. The two most common belay-device styles are tubular and assisted-braking.</td>

            A small and beautiful restaurant. It offers fresh and local food. It is better to make a reservation. Rooms are also available for overnight stay.

        <p> Sarah - <b><big><q><i>Great Cooking!</i></q></big></b>
        <blockquote>
            This small restaurant offers great food using high quality local produce. Excellent wines offered as well. It is located in a lovely village in the Kaiserstuhl area, about 15 minutes drive from Breisach, a town in Baden on the Rhine. I believe that it is accessible by local bus as well. Rooms are available for overnight stays.

    <!-- I include comic sans because it drives graphic designers crazy -->
    <p style="font-family: new century schoolbook"> My Major is in computer science. This wasn't my intented major, orenginally my major was criminal justice. After taking a Intro. to Programming class and I developed an interest. Then I started to take other classes in programming. That's when I notice, I tend to enter a state of flow and I wouldn't stop until it worked. Plus I'm a thinker. This has lead me to learn object orianted methods in C#, C++, and Java. where it lead me how to develop software for clientals. While working in team we made a calender/ appointment program. In this experience of mine, I learned we each had different experience. In the matter of four month I taught myself to understand about database and communatcation to make my part of the program work. Never wait till 3 days till the program is due to make the whole thing work, but we did it. </p>
    
    <p style="font-family: new century schoolbook"> I feel that having knowlege in web design can benefit my career experience.By creating a website that can act as a business card. This can creat traffic for me, by having employers seeing my experience. Also, creating customer demands and seperating myself from competitors.Plus, there is always company looking to improve thier website.</p>
    
    <p style="font-family: new century schoolbook"> I grow up playing Hockey. I've been playing since I was 8. I played other sports like soccer, baseball, basketball, and football. I fell in love with hockey, because it was different. Or maybe it was that I wasn't really good at it first and it took time for me to develop my skill. Over the years of playing hockey, it lead me to playing higher level of hockey. Where I met and made friends. It also allowed me to travel the US. When I turn 21 and played my last year of Jr. hockey, my folks made me decide to work or go back to school. I think you can figure out what I did.</p>

            <p> This type of wine is vinified at cold temperatures in stainless steel tank. The wine is aged in the cellars for 8 to 10 months with about 30% of the final blend seeing time in new and used oak. This 100% Chardonnay begins with aromas of green apple, wet stone and light toast are followed by great acidity and minerality.</p>

            <h2>Buy Cabernet Sauvignon for $30.</h2>
            <img src="wine-186018_640.png" float: left width="300px" height="200px">
            <p> This wine is full bodied and balanced with a savory nose of blackberries, cassis, spice and a hint of peppermint that go well with the beefy flavors of gourmet selections from Omaha Steaks. Sit back and soak up the taste of rich black cherry, mocha espresso, brown spice and caramel as they unfold gracefully across the palate with smooth, silky tannins and a long elegant finish.</p>
